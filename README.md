aspnet-identity-rtm
===================

I upgraded the SPA template to RTM of Asp.Net Identity.

Theres properly a few bugs and all, but i just put the project here if someone else get stuck. (took me some hours figuring out all the changes from rc to rtm).


I am new to asp.net identity. So if your goo at it, feel free to do a pull request. I didnt do anything other then make it work.

and ye, i did some db migrations to see how easy it was to upgrade the user. Guess I should write a blog post about that.
